# PWA Icons

This app requires two icon files for proper PWA functionality:

1. `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels

## Quick Icon Generation

You can create these icons using any image editor or online tool:

1. Create a square image (192x192 or 512x512)
2. Use the app's primary color (#0ea5e9) as background
3. Add "WA" text or your logo
4. Save as PNG format
5. Place both files in the `/public` directory

## Temporary Solution

For now, the app will use the favicon.ico as a fallback, but proper icons are recommended for the best PWA experience.
